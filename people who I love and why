people who I love and why

I like characters - people with some layers to unfurl and explore

Sally
	a thoughtful ear
	shared dance experiences
	common tastes and complaints

Matthew






Annika
	convo topics
		how do you find charging money for something changes the experience?
		the value of and appreciation for independence
		I think it's good to get bored every now and then- get bored around interesting people
			have nothing to do except talk and explore
		wouldn't it be great to work as a tavern keep and have good long convos with people
		or run a retreat for interesting characters - for friends of friends only (2 degrees separation)
			bringing people with deep knowledge of diverse backgrounds together, get them bored and see what falls out
