	Fun day today. Did some cooking - brisket in pressure cooker with soy sauce, italian herbs, and garlic is delish. Then went climbing for the evening. I think I'm building back to my previous form pretty well. My overall fitness / strength seems to be better than originally (likely thanks to the ski patrol course), although of course my forearm endurance is still very weak. Top-roping 22s, (maybe a 23 with some work). Feeling pretty strong. Missed out on doing my duolingo/uke practise, which is disappointing- should get back into that pronto tomorrow.
	Yesterday was a really full on day. Started off the afternoon climbing with Charlotte. She is the cutest girl. Still massively conflicted with how to approach this relationship. On the one hand, she's 18. Which is sort of a massive problem. On the other hand, she's super easy to talk to, seems intelligent, mature, and we share common interests (climbing and dance). But she's 18. Bollocks. One slight thing to investigate- she seems to be slightly discouraged by things she finds difficult (ie prefers slab to overhangs because that's what she's good at. Wonder if there's something deeper there?). I'm also attracted to her super positive outlook on life and of course her youth is absolutely delightful. Should ask her out for coffee or a longer chat, also see if she's in a relationship (Daniel? can't fully tell. She's definitely flirting with me, not sure if seriously).
	Evening, went to zouk practica. Really enjoyed the session. The music was slow, lyrical and flowing, which seems to suit my dance style (if it can be called that at this early stage) quite well. I only seem to have few movements (basic, lateral, bonus, viraginha, basket return), but they can be fun with a responsive partner and interesting music. Still need to work on the yoyo - I seem to lose connection at the open out. On the plus, I've learnt the steps behind (relearnt :P) the elastico. It's a super fun move that I need to practise more of! Pointers on my technique - need to lead more from legs, to make it easier for the follower to feel more subtle movements. When leading, engage frame same as while following. Extend my leg, but don't land until the lead does (when following). Land on the balls (ie, not toes, not heels). Try to lead on the beat to make it easier to follow (or have more strength & clarity behind the lead).
