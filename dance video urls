Hi Sousa, I'm fairly new to Tango, but I've been doing zouk for a bit longer. Do you think it'll be okay if we played a zouk song or two on Tuesday, or if I posted something on the wanaka tango page to see if anyone would be interested?

Here's zouk mixed in with some bolero (looks pretty tango-esque to me though! :D )
