Find something you're passionate about / interested in
Figure out what the hard parts of that subject are
Focus on the hard parts until they become intuitive
Play / break / make mistakes with the hard parts and see what amazing things fall out

parasites are not just biological. they do not need to be self-aware, or even have a brain. some species of orchids, instead of producing nectar, imitates a female wasp, and gets pollinated in this way, to no benefit to the wasp. A comparisons could be made to, say, facebook. How much time do we spend feeding facebook, which we would look back and regard as being well spent, nurturing, worth living through?

I'm curious how many aspects of our web are like those orchids, appealing to the next dopamine hit, without giving us any real benefit.
