Hi there recess peoples!

Just a heads up, this is a bit of a silly question.

Recently, I've been talking with some friends who do various dances about how our local dance community seems to be missing an element of play and informal feedback, and the freedom to try out different ways of moving. I understand you guys are probably super busy, or occupied with other things right now, so feel free to ignore. But on the off chance you might have some stuff on hand, I was wondering if you might be able to share any notes or point me at anything online to keep in mind for building a practica / experimental environment?

Thanks again for running an event based around such a wonderful concept, and hope you guys can find a way to continue! (I'm heading to Europe next year, and would love to join in anything similar that might be running still?).

Cheers,
Jason
