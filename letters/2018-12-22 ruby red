Hi Ruby,

I've never met you in person, so it must be a bit strange for me to message you out of the blue. To explain why- Firstly, I saw a video of you dancing switch with Justin Riley in a kitchen, and loved the play and connection. I also remember reading that you used to run a blues / fusion experimental practica group where everyone gave and received feedback. And finally, I've been talking with some friends who do various dances (modern jive, WCS, zouk and kizomba), and how our local dance community seems to be missing an element of play and the freedom to try out different ways of moving ( I'm based in Auckland, NZ).

I understand you're probably super busy. But just on the off chance you might have some stuff on hand, I was wondering if you might be able to share any notes or point me at anything online to keep in mind for building a practica / experimental environment? If not, thanks for reading through this awkward rambling, and thanks for being a huge inspiration for me to learning both lead/follow, and having a natural, relaxed aesthetic to aspire to.

Cheers,
Jason
