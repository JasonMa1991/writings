lead
	can try to lead every movement, or give the follower more freedom / trust
		by trusting the follower to do her part, the lead is liberated to engage more with the music, be more creative, express more
	following requires trust - trust in the leader, and trust in my own body.
		(establish common ground, explore underlying assumptions)
		To lead well, I have to first establish that trust for the follower that I know what I'm doing
		To get the most out of a follower, I have to get her to trust her own movement, to relax and do her thing
	leading is about seeing what is happening around, and feeling what is about to happen next
		reading the floor- guiding our partnership so we don't run into anybody or anything
		feeling the music and intuiting when something interesting is approaching so we can both enjoy that moment
		leading is also being responsive to the follow when they give feedback- they can see certain blindspots, and I shouldn't miss this
