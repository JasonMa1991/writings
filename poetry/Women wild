Beware, young man, of women wild, for soon they'll steal your heart-
They're brave and free, a sight to see, too soon you'll have to part.
For being wild, and being free, their wings shall not be bound,
And come one day, not far away, their trace shall not be found.

For that bright soul, the spark, that life, the flame that lights those eyes,
Burns only bright, with space to dance, to spread those wing in flight.
And if you try to hold her tight, to hold her in your sight,
Then all you do is dim the flame, smother'd to its demise.

So what, young man, is left to you? What save tears and sorrow?
But see her go, let her be, and face your fears tomorrow.
A wildling child is not to keep, but treasure while she's near.
Though should you but care to listen, her song you still may hear.
