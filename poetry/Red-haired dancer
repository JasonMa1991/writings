You stole the room, you stole my air,
With flowing legs and flame-lit hair.
We flew, we circled, about the room,
Till music ended, all too soon.

And in that dim, and in that gloom,
Our motions played so sweet a tune.
Two hearts, a breath, four legged beast,
The world around, and time, but ceased.

You were my all, you brought my best.
For all the world, lay 'pon my chest.
And for a time, my world spun round,
And in the spinning, hope was found.

Spurred on by whimsy, I grew bold
So at song's end, I switched our hold.
For as you followed like a dream,
I hoped you'd lead as clear and clean.

And lead you did, with arm and knee,
Slowly to start, then with great glee.
Our roles reversed, I was entranced, (I was in trance)
In blind embrace, lost as we danced. (lost to the dance)

You caught my eye, for being so fair,
You seized my heart, for being so rare.
from frozen lands
Your stay too short, on our black sands
