follow
	following is a choice
	being in a relaxed frame of mind and body makes everything easier (or even doable)
	being clear about what I want, then get out of the way
	better to be decisive, (make a mistake), and laugh it off, than stress out (corollary: there will always be mistakes)
	expectations are important- try to 
	don't rush into things
	as a follower, better to be a touch behind, and listen to the lead, than to rush ahead and get disconnected
	following is a choice - easier in some ways, harder in others
		a good follow can make almost any decision seem to work out / succeed
	feedback is important - in the right circumstances
		(in practica, not in social dancing <--> in private, not at a client presentation)
	A smile can make almost anything better
